QUESTION
Implement a Surgery Class with Comparison Methods
- Task: Create a class Surgery that represents
a surgery with properties SurgeryID and Duration (in minutes).
Implement the following methods:
Equals, NotEquals, GreaterThan,
GreaterThanEquals, LessThan, and LessThanEquals
to compare the durations of two surgeries.
- Requirements:
- Implement the Equals(Surgery other) method to check
if two surgeries have the same duration.
- Implement the NotEquals(Surgery other) method to check
if two surgeries have different durations.
- Implement the GreaterThan(Surgery other) method to check
if one surgery takes longer than another.
- Implement the GreaterThanEquals(Surgery other) method to check
if one surgery takes longer or the same amount of time as another.
- Implement the LessThan(Surgery other) method to check
if one surgery takes less time than another.
- Implement the LessThanEquals(Surgery other) method to check
if one surgery takes less or the same amount of time as another.
- Example:
```csharp
Surgery s1 = new Surgery("S001", 90);
Surgery s2 = new Surgery("S002", 120);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Surgery
{
    public string SurgeryID;
    public int duration;

public Surgery(string SurgeryID, int duration)
    {
        this.SurgeryID = SurgeryID;
        this.duration = duration;
    }

    public bool Equal(Surgery other)
    {
        return this.duration == other.duration;
    }

    public bool NotEqual(Surgery other)
    {
        return this.duration != other.duration;
    }

    public bool GreaterThan(Surgery other)
    {
        return this.duration > other.duration;
    }

    public bool GreaterThanEqual(Surgery other)
    {
        return this.duration >= other.duration;
    }

    public bool LessThan(Surgery other)
    {
        return this.duration < other.duration;
    }

    public bool LessThanEqual(Surgery other)
    {
        return this.duration <= other.duration;
    }
}

{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Surgery s1 = new Surgery("S1", 90);
        Surgery s2 = new Surgery("S2", 120);
        if (s1.Equal(s2))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("First surgery duration is equal to second");
        }
        else if (s1.LessThanEqual(s2))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("First surgery duration less than or equal to second surgery");
        }
        else if (s1.GreaterThan(s2))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("First surgery duration is greater than second surgery duration");
        }
        else if (s1.GreaterThanEqual(s2))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("First surgery duration is greater than or equal to second surgery");
